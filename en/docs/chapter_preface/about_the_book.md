# About This Book

This project aims to create an open-source, free, beginner-friendly introductory tutorial on data structures and algorithms.

- The entire book uses animated illustrations, with clear and easy-to-understand content and a smooth learning curve, guiding beginners to explore the knowledge map of data structures and algorithms.
- The source code can be run with one click, helping readers improve their programming skills through practice and understand how algorithms work and the underlying implementation of data structures.
- We encourage readers to learn from each other, and everyone is welcome to ask questions and share insights in the comments section, making progress together through discussion and exchange.

## Target Audience

If you are an algorithm beginner who has never been exposed to algorithms, or if you already have some problem-solving experience and have a vague understanding of data structures and algorithms, oscillating between knowing and not knowing, then this book is tailor-made for you!

If you have already accumulated a certain amount of problem-solving experience and are familiar with most question types, this book can help you review and organize your algorithm knowledge system, and the repository's source code can be used as a "problem-solving toolkit" or "algorithm dictionary."

If you are an algorithm "expert," we look forward to receiving your valuable suggestions, or [participating in creation together](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_appendix/contribution/).

!!! success "Prerequisites"

    You need to have at least a programming foundation in any language, and be able to read and write simple code.

## Content Structure

The main content of this book is shown in the figure below.

- **Complexity analysis**: Evaluation dimensions and methods for data structures and algorithms. Methods for calculating time complexity and space complexity, common types, examples, etc.
- **Data structures**: Classification methods for basic data types and data structures. The definition, advantages and disadvantages, common operations, common types, typical applications, implementation methods, etc. of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps, and graphs.
- **Algorithms**: The definition, advantages and disadvantages, efficiency, application scenarios, problem-solving steps, and example problems of algorithms such as searching, sorting, divide and conquer, backtracking, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.

During the creation of this book, I received help from many people.

- Thanks to my mentor at the company, Dr. Li Xi, who encouraged me to "take action quickly" during a conversation, strengthening my determination to write this book;
- Thanks to my girlfriend Bubble as the first reader of this book, who provided many valuable suggestions from the perspective of an algorithm beginner, making this book more suitable for novices to read;
- Thanks to Tengbao, Qibao, and Feibao for coming up with a creative name for this book, evoking everyone's fond memories of writing their first line of code "Hello World!";
- Thanks to Xiaoquan for providing professional help in intellectual property rights, which played an important role in the improvement of this open-source book;
- Thanks to Sutong for designing the beautiful cover and logo for this book, and for patiently making revisions multiple times driven by my obsessive-compulsive disorder;
- Thanks to @squidfunk for the typesetting suggestions, as well as for developing the open-source documentation theme [Material-for-MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/tree/master).

During the writing process, I read many textbooks and articles on data structures and algorithms. These works provided excellent examples for this book and ensured the accuracy and quality of the book's content. I would like to thank all the teachers and predecessors for their outstanding contributions!

This book advocates a learning method that combines hands and brain, and in this regard I was deeply inspired by [Dive into Deep Learning](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-zh). I highly recommend this excellent work to all readers.

**Heartfelt thanks to my parents, it is your support and encouragement that has given me the opportunity to do this interesting thing**.
