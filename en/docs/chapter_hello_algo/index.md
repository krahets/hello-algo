# Before starting

A few years ago, I shared the "Sword for Offer" problem solutions on LeetCode, receiving encouragement and support from many readers. During interactions with readers, the most common question I encountered was "how to get started with algorithms." Gradually, I developed a keen interest in this question.

Directly solving problems seems to be the most popular method â€” it's simple, direct, and effective. However, problem-solving is like playing Minesweeper: those with strong self-study skills can navigate the pitfalls one by one, while those lacking a solid foundation may find themselves repeatedly stumbling and retreating in frustration. Reading through textbooks is also a common practice, but for job seekers, writing graduation thesis, submitting resumes, preparing for written tests and interviews have already consumed most of their energy, and reading thick books often becomes a daunting challenge.

If you're facing similar troubles, then this book is lucky to have found you. This book is my answer to the question. While it may not be the best solution, it is at least a positive attempt. Although this book is not enough to get you an offer directly, it will guide you to explore the "knowledge map" of data structures and algorithms, help you understand the shapes, sizes, and locations of different "mines", and enable you to master various "mine clearance methods". With these skills, I believe you can solve problems and read literature more comfortably, gradually building a knowledge system.

I deeply agree with Professor Feynman's statement: "Knowledge isn't free. You have to pay attention." In this sense, this book is not entirely "free." In order to live up to your precious "attention" for this book, I will do my best and devote my greatest "attention" to write this book.

Aware of my limitations, I recognize that despite the content of this book being refined over time, errors surely remain. I sincerely welcome critiques and corrections from both teachers and students.

The advent of computers has brought significant changes to the world. With their high-speed computing power and excellent programmability, they have become the ideal medium for executing algorithms and processing data. Whether it's the realistic graphics of video games, the intelligent decisions in autonomous driving, the brilliant Go games of AlphaGo, or the natural interactions of ChatGPT, these applications are all exquisite demonstrations of algorithms at work on computers.

In fact, before the advent of computers, algorithms and data structures already existed in every corner of the world. Early algorithms were relatively simple, such as ancient counting methods and tool-making procedures. As civilization progressed, algorithms became more refined and complex. From the exquisite craftsmanship of artisans, to industrial products that liberate productive forces, to the scientific laws governing the universe, almost every ordinary or astonishing thing has behind it the ingenious thought of algorithms.

Similarly, data structures are everywhere: from social networks to subway lines, many systems can be modeled as "graphs"; from a country to a family, the main forms of social organization exhibit characteristics of "trees"; winter clothes are like a "stack", where the first item worn is the last to be taken off; a badminton shuttle tube resembles a "queue", with one end for insertion and the other for retrieval; a dictionary is like a "hash table", enabling quick search for target entries.

This book aims to help readers understand the core concepts of algorithms and data structures through clear, easy-to-understand animated illustrations and runnable code examples, and to be able to implement them through programming. On this basis, this book strives to reveal the vivid manifestations of algorithms in the complex world, showcasing the beauty of algorithms. I hope this book can help you!
